# Socket-Programming
Use socket programming to implement a simple client and server that communicate over the network and implement a simple application involving Cash Registers. The client implements a simple cash register that opens a session with the
server and then supplies a sequence of codes
(refer request-response messages format) for some products. The server returns the price
of each one, and also keeps a running total of purchases for each clients transactions. When the client
closes the session, the server returns the total co
st. This is how the point-of-sale terminals should
work.
